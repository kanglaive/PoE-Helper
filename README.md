# [PoE-Helper](https://github.com/kanglaive/PoE-Helper) - [Project Page](https://kanglaive.github.io/PoE-Helper/)

This application is meant to be a spiritual successor to the POE-ItemInfo AHK script as well as the POE-TradeMacro AHK script. The core focus of this app is to provide similar aiding features such as item mod checking and item pricing while being built through Java. This project was approached ground-up, and intended to be shared with the PoE dev community, and to provide the groundworks for Java in PoE tool development.
